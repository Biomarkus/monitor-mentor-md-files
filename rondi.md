Branches
I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

stage is the development branch.

master is the production branch.

No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

Steps to work with feature branch

To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with feat and followed by feature name. (ie. feat-FEATURE-NAME)
Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.
Steps to create a pull request

Make a PR to stage branch.
Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.
After this, changes will be merged.

❗ Guideline
coding guidelines or other things you want people to follow should follow.
